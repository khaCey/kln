# Usage:
# 1. Ensure this compose file and Dockerfile are in the same directory in your repo.
# 2. If deploying via Portainer (Repository), set the Compose file path to this fileâ€™s location.
# 3. Deploy the stack; Portainer will build and start the container on host port 75.
# 4. Browse to http://<host-ip>:75 to see your site.
# 5. On HTML changes (./html), simply: docker-compose restart static-site
